## Interfaces

[`rand_core`] defines [`RngCore`] and other core traits, as well as several helpers for implementing RNGs.

The [`getrandom`] crate provides a low-level API around platform-specific
random-number sources.

## Pseudo-random generators

The following crates implement pseudo-random number generators
(see [Our RNGs](guide-rngs.md)):

-   [`rand_chacha`] provides generators using the ChaCha cipher
-   [`rand_hc`] implements a generator using the HC-128 cipher
-   [`rand_isaac`] implements the ISAAC generators
-   [`rand_pcg`] implements a small selection of PCG generators
-   [`rand_xoshiro`] implements the SplitMix and Xoshiro generators
-   [`rand_xorshift`] implements the basic Xorshift generator

Exceptionally, [`SmallRng`] is implemented directly in [`rand`].

## rand (main crate)

The [`rand`] crate is designed for easy usage of common random-number
functionality. This has several aspects:

-   the [`rngs`] module provides a few convenient generators
-   the [`distr`] module concerns sampling of random values
-   the [`seq`] module concerns sampling from and shuffling sequences
-   the [`Rng`] trait provides a few convenience methods for generating
    random values
-   the [`random`] function provides convenient generation in a single call

## Distributions

The [`rand`] crate only implements sampling from the most common random
number distributions: uniform and weighted sampling. For everything else,

-   [`rand_distr`] provides fast sampling from a variety of other distributions,
    including Normal (Gauss), Binomial, Poisson, UnitCircle, and many more
-   [`statrs`] is a port of the C# Math.NET library, implementing many of the
    same distributions (plus/minus a few), along with PDF and CDF functions,
    the *error*, *beta*, *gamma* and *logistic* special functions, plus a few
    utilities. (For clarity, [`statrs`] is not part of the Rand library.)
